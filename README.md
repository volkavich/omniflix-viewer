### Highlights of the Project
    
* Tried to combine Neobrutalistic Design Trend with Glassmorphism Design Trend that Omniflix uses.
* Used [Graz](https://graz.strange.love/docs/) from [StrangeLove](https://strange.love/) to easily integrate Keplr to the Front-End.
* Tried to pay homeage to Omniflix's existing Design by replicating and iterating upon the Omniflix's Design language as much as possible.
* Used only Vanilla HTML and CSS with no additional frameworks or UI libraries for the Design.
